# Note: This script only adds aliases.
# If you also wanted to add the environment variable:
# MOVIE_DIR="/mnt/movie/data/media/movies"
# You would add a similar check and append logic for:
# export_command="export MOVIE_DIR=\"/mnt/movie/data/media/movies\""

# For simplicity, this part is commented out but shows how you could extend it.
