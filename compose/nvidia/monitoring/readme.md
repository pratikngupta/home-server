# Project Overview

This project uses Docker Compose to manage multiple services. Here's a brief overview of each service:

## Uptime Kuma

## Dockge

Dockge is a Docker management user interface. It allows you to manage your Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes.

## Dozzle

[Dozzle](https://github.com/amir20/dozzle) is a simple, lightweight application that provides you with a web-based interface to monitor your Docker container logs live.

## Diun

[Diun](https://github.com/crazy-max/diun) is a Docker image update notifier. It can be used to receive notifications when a Docker image is updated on a Docker registry.

## Speedtest

The [Speedtest](https://hub.docker.com/r/openspeedtest/latest) service is a Docker container for testing your internet bandwidth using [OpenSpeedTest](http://openspeedtest.com/).

# Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, you can clone this repository and start all services:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
docker-compose up -d
```

Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with the URL of this repository and the directory you want to clone it into, respectively.

# Configuration

Each service has its own configuration options, which you can modify in the `docker-compose.yml` file. For example, you can change the volume paths, environment variables, and network settings.

Please refer to the documentation for each service for more information on how to configure them.
